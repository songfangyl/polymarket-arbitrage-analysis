# Implementation Plan: Market Metadata Integration

## Current State

âœ… **What You Have:**
- âœ… Trade data: `../joined_data/trades-joined-2025-04-*.csv` (April-September 2025)
- âœ… Market metadata: `../market_info_data/markets-raw-shared-2025-04-08.jsonl`
- âœ… Token lookup: `data/token_lookup.csv` (216,013 tokens mapped to markets)

## Clean Project Structure

```
polymarket-arbitrage-analysis/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ token_lookup.csv          # Token â†’ Market mapping (ready to use)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Data documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts_archive/              # Old investigation scripts (ignore)
â”œâ”€â”€ create_token_lookup.py        # Script to rebuild token_lookup.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ example_usage.py              # Usage examples (reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ METADATA_GUIDE.md            # How the metadata file works
â””â”€â”€ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md       # This file
```

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Quick Analysis (Recommended to Start)

**Goal:** Explore your trade data with categories and metadata

**Steps:**
1. Load one day of trades
2. Merge with token_lookup
3. Analyze by category, market, arbitrage opportunities

**Time:** ~30 minutes

**Script:** See `scripts/quick_analysis.py` (I'll create this)

---

### Option B: Full Dataset Processing

**Goal:** Enrich ALL trade files with metadata and save

**Steps:**
1. Process all CSV files (April-September)
2. Add category, question, outcome, condition_id
3. Save enriched files or database

**Time:** ~1-2 hours (depending on volume)

**Script:** See `scripts/enrich_all_trades.py` (I'll create this)

---

### Option C: Custom Analysis

**Goal:** Specific analysis based on your research needs

Tell me what you want to analyze:
- [ ] Arbitrage opportunities between related outcomes?
- [ ] Volume distribution by category?
- [ ] Price movements for specific markets?
- [ ] Market correlation analysis?
- [ ] Other: _______________

## Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Quick Analysis (5 mins)

```bash
uv run --with pandas scripts/quick_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Load 1 day of trades
- Show you what the enriched data looks like
- Give you category breakdown
- Show top markets by volume

### Step 2: Decide on Approach

Based on Step 1 results, choose:
- **If data looks good:** Proceed to Option B (enrich all files)
- **If you need specific analysis:** Tell me and I'll create Option C
- **If categories are too sparse:** I can create a better categorization using question text

### Step 3: Execute

Run the chosen approach and start your analysis!

## What's Your Goal?

Before I create the implementation scripts, please tell me:

1. **What's your end goal?**
   - Arbitrage detection?
   - Market analysis?
   - Trading strategy backtesting?
   - Research/paper?

2. **What do you want as output?**
   - Enriched CSV files?
   - Database (SQLite/ClickHouse)?
   - Analysis reports?
   - Visualization/dashboard?

3. **Do you need category filtering?**
   - Yes, but only ~7% have categories
   - No, I'll work with all markets
   - Yes, create better categories using question text

Let me know and I'll create the exact scripts you need! ðŸš€
